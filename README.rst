Excitonic insulators are usually considered to form via the condensation of a soft charge mode of bound electron-hole pairs [1–5]. This, however, presumes that the soft exciton is of spin-singlet character. Early theoretical considerations have also predicted a very distinct scenario, in which the condensation of magnetic spin-triplet excitons result in an antiferromagnetic excitonic insulator state [6–9]. Here we report resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements and theoretical modeling of the anisotropic bilayer antiferromagnet Sr3Ir2O7, which isolate an excitonic magnetic mode. The identification of this mode is the key signature of the antiferromagnetic excitonic insulator and establishes the material as a realization of this historic phase of matter.
